1. Create group events. Users are able to invite other registered users to their events. Invited users cannot be invited again. Group events can be edited by any user invited to the event, and the edit will change the event for all invited users. Group events can be deleted on individual calendars, but not everyone's calendars. These events can be sorted by tags.

2. Share calendar. Registered users can share their calendar with other registered users. All events created or shared to you will be copied to the other user, as long as that user is registered on the website. Users can see but not edit or delete events that have been shared by shared by calendar. These events cannot be sorted by tags.

3. Tag your events, and view your calendar by tags. When logged in, you can create events under specific tags, such as personal, work, and school. Once these events appear on your calendar, you can use the display tags above the calendar to select the events, by tag, that you want to see on your calendar.
